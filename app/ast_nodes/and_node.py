        # For example, let D1 and D2 and D3 => let (D1, D2, D3)
        # If it standardizes to a single EqualNode, it needs a clear target for left/right.
        # A common way to handle 'and' is to make a list of assignments.
        # Or, if it means simultaneous equations, the evaluation strategy is complex.
        # For now, sticking to the structure but noting the issue with EqualNode.
        # If the intention is to create a single EqualNode where left is a tuple of vars
        # and right is a tuple of expressions, e.g., (x,y) = (E1,E2), then EqualNode needs adjustment.

        # Assuming each dr in standardized_Drs is an EqualNode (var = expr)
        # The original code implies creating an EqualNode where 'left' is a list of variables
        # and 'right' is a list of expressions. This structure needs to be supported by EqualNode.
        
        # If EqualNode is strictly (list_of_vars_on_left, single_expr_on_right for tuple assignment)
        # or (single_var_on_left, single_expr_on_right), then this standardization is incorrect.
        # Let's assume for now the structure was intended, and EqualNode might need to be flexible
        # or this is a specific interpretation of 'and'.
        
        # Given EqualNode(left: list[ASTNode], right: ASTNode)
        # The original standardization for AndNode is:
        # EqualNode(left=[dr.left for dr in standardized_Drs], right=[dr.right for dr in standardized_Drs])
        # This passes a list to `right`, which is not what `EqualNode` expects.
        # I will keep the structure but this will likely fail or needs `EqualNode` to be adapted.
        # A more plausible standardization might be to a list of EqualNodes or a special AndStandardizedNode.
        # For now, I will replicate the potentially problematic line.
        
        # This line will cause a type error if EqualNode's right is strictly ASTNode.
        # It should probably be a list of EqualNodes or a TauNode of EqualNodes if 'and' means a sequence.
        # Or if it's parallel assignment, EqualNode needs to handle list for right.
        # For now, let's assume the user had a specific structure in mind for EqualNode.
        
        # Replicating the original structure:
        # This will likely require EqualNode's `right` to accept `list[ASTNode]`.
