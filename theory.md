## theory facts:

## Lexical Analyzer = Regular Grammar + Input Characters → Tokens

## Parser = CFG + Tokens → Parse Tree
A parser takes the tokens from the Lexical Analyzer and checks whether those tokens follow the grammar rules of the language.
It builds a parse tree (or abstract syntax tree) based on those rules.






## TG and CFG. ##
✅ The structure (shape) of the derivation tree is the same in TG and CFG.
But...

🔥 TG often shows only the translation output, not all the intermediate steps.
That’s why it looks shorter or more compact — because it focuses on the meaning, not just the syntax.

🧠 Think of it like this:
1. CFG Tree (Full syntax tree)
Shows:

css
Copy
Edit
E
├── E
│   └── i
├── +
└── T
    └── i
It includes every token and rule used in parsing.

2. TG Output (Translation tree or result)
Just gives you:

css
Copy
Edit
+
├── i
└── i
✅ Cleaner, because it skips all the intermediate symbols and focuses on what the computation means (postfix or AST).
